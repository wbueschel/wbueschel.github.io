In this project, my colleagues and I explored the concept of **R**eality-**B**ased **I**nformation **R**etrieval, which combines the classic information retrieval process with augmented-reality technologies to provide context-dependent search cues and situated visualizations of the query and the results.

Information needs are often triggered by specific real-world experiences. Therefore, this novel combination has the potential to better support both just-in-time information retrieval and serendipity.
