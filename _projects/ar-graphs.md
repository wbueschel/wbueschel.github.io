Networks are a particularly important type of data for immersive visualizations, as they are used to show relations between real and virtual objects. Examples of such relations are computer networks, information flows in a smart home, and connections between situated visualizations. However, there was little research on how to design immersive AR node-link visualizations. Thus, in this project, we investigated how to design edge visualizations in 3D node-link diagrams. To this end, we conducted two studies in which we examined which visual variables are most suitable and how different edge styles perform compared to each other.
