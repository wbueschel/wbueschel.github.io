In CleAR Sight, we explored the potential of transparent interaction panels in head-mounted AR. Together with my colleagues, I built a research platform based on a custom touch-enabled transparent interaction panel. We developed a series of interaction concepts for this platform and demonstrated them in the context of three use case scenarios: the exploration of 3D volumetric data, collaborative visual data analysis, and the control of smart home appliances.

The software is mostly written in C# for the main Unity prototype, with a touch data provider written in C/C++ on the interaction panel.
