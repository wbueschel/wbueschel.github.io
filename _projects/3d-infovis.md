One of my research interests lies in the usage of spatial interaction with mobile devices for immersive 3D visualizations. To contribute to a better understanding of this interaction style, we implemented example visualizations on a spatially tracked tablet and investigated their usage and potential.

    This is our technical setup: The tablet is tracked in 3D space, the visual content is virtually placed on a table.
