Hi, my name is Wolfgang Büschel, welcome to my website!  
I am a computer scientist, and I am currently working as a post-doctoral researcher at the [VISUS](https://www.visus.uni-stuttgart.de) of the University of Stuttgart, Germany.

In 2023, I successfully defended my Ph.D. on _Spatial Interaction for Immersive Mixed-Reality Visualizations_ at the [Interactive Media Lab Dresden](https://imld.de). My research areas are immersive & situated analytics and advanced mixed-reality interfaces. Specifically, I am interested in mixed-presence collaboration in immersive environments, immersive data stories, and the use of AI technologies for situated & embodied interfaces.

For more information on my research, please check out my [publications](/publications). For a quick overview, you can find some highlights of my work on the [projects](/projects) page. I am always looking forward to new, exciting collaborations, so if you have some ideas, let's talk about them! You can find all the contact details at the bottom of the page.

I am also a hobby photographer, mostly focusing on landscapes and architecture. I continuously try to improve, so any feedback on my [pictures](/projects#photos) is welcome!
